 private void ResetGame()
 {
     score = 0;
     label1.Text = "Score: " + score;
     player.Location = initialPlayerPosition;
     foreach (Control control in this.Controls)
     {
         if (control is PictureBox pictureBox)
         {
             pictureBox.Location = initialPositions[pictureBox];
         }
     }
     isGameRunning = false;
     timer1.Stop();
 }
